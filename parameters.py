"""

Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning methods include techniques like knowledge distillation, 
pruning, and quantization. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large model 
to a smaller one. Pruning removes unnecessary parameters, and quantization reduces precision.
Each method has trade-offs; for example, pruning may lead to loss of information,
while quantization may reduce model accuracy.
